This project was bootstrapped with:

 - [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

Get started:

    $ yarn start

This series of pomodoro projects were based on a FreeCodeCamp challenge:

  - [Pomodoro](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock)

They build upon a JS only implementation that although very simple, follows some
of the main concepts behind a React/Redux architecture, they gradually build
upon each other to a complete React/Redux solution (this repo):

  - [reduxish](https://github.com/jbonigomes/pomodoro-reduxish)
  - [redux](https://github.com/jbonigomes/pomodoro-redux)
  - [react](https://github.com/jbonigomes/pomodoro-react)
  - [immutable.js](https://github.com/jbonigomes/pomodoro-immutable)

I consider this series a quick shortcut to get aquainted to the React/Redux
architecture, however, there are many basic topics still left untouch. My
reccomendation is to consider the following before moving along:

- Material-UI
- SASS/SCSS
- Moment.js
- Ramda
- Axios
- Airbnb style guide
- Jest
- Enzyme
- Cucumber
- React router
- Auth0
- PropTypes
- Flow or Typescript
